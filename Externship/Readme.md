The project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying song genres based on Spotify data. Spotify is a popular music streaming platform that provides a vast amount of information about songs, including audio features like tempo, energy, danceability, instrumentalness, and more. Leveraging this data, the goal is to build a robust and accurate classification system capable of predicting the genre of a given song.
